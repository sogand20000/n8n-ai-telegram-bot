# Telegram AI Bot

This project is an interactive Telegram bot powered by AI. Users can send messages to the bot, and the AI will respond intelligently.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Telegram Trigger:** Receives messages from the Telegram bot.
2. **AI Agent:** Connected to the Gemini AI model to generate intelligent responses.
3. **Text Cleaning:** Removes extra characters that Telegram bot cannot handle.
4. **Send Response:** Sends the AI-generated text back to the Telegram bot.

## Usage

1. Send a message to the Telegram bot.
2. The AI will process your message and reply with a smart response.

## Notes

* Ensure your Telegram Bot API token is correctly configured in n8n.
* The workflow handles character escaping to prevent Telegram parsing errors.
